        </h3>
        <p>
          We help people with ideas develop their Version 1.0 a.k.a Minimum Viable Product. Our purpose is simple and straightforward &mdash; if you have an idea for a product, we will develop its first version/prototype.
        </p>
        <p class="bg-warning text-center" style="padding: 8px 0px">
          We specialize in building database-backed applications, mobile APIs, and static websites.
        </p>
        <h4>
          How We Do This
        </h4>
        <p>
          We operate at high speed and understand the tradeoffs necessary to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our stated goal is to get something in your hands _quick_. We take projects that can be accomplished in <strong>1-2 weeks</strong>. That's how fast we work.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Why Us
        </h4>
        <p>
          We have over seven years of experience developing and launching web and mobile applications from the ground up. We've taken ideas from conception to launch and beyond. In the process, we've learned a ton of what it takes and what it means to build a v1.0 product.
        </p>
        <p>
          A 1.0 of a product is a very different beast than your later, more polished versions. The first version of your product needs to be <u>useful</u>, <u>functional</u>, and provide you with the feedback you need to iterate and achieve product-market fit. Speed and time to market matters. Functionality matters. Learning what your users really want matters. <em>Polish, not so much</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goals may vary &mdash; whether you want to validate and test your hypothesis or show a prototype while you raise your seed round, we build something that serves that need and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are NOT your typical outsourced software consultancy that will give you an hourly rate and a bloated estimate how long it takes to develop something. We want to build something fast and have you take it to the market and test it.
        </p>

          NOTE: We have not added native mobile apps to our kitty yet. Again, our ethos is we want to build you a p-o-c in technologies we are familiar with and prototype rapidly.

          In the technologies and services we offer, we stand by the quality of work and our speed. We are mid-level (5+ years industry) and senior (10+ years industry) engineers. More importantly, we have launched products from the ground up and know the tradeoffs necessary to develop a 1.0 prototype. No one will do it faster and better than us.
